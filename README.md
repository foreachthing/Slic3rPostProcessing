# Slic3r-Post-Processing

## Important!
Due to Python naming conventions, I've renamed the main file to `main.py`. It's no longer `Slic3rPostProcessor`. Everything else remains the same. So, don't forget to change the settings in your slicer.

### Example
PrusaSlicer possible post-processing script:

`"C:\Users\USER\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python311\python.exe" "h:\dev\Slic3rPostProcessing\SPP-Python\main.py" --filecounter --nomove --proglayer --iob -iobh=4 --iobfl;`

This line will enable printing individual objects in blocks of 4 mm (`--iob --iobh=4`), first layer of each object will be printed as first layer `--fl`. Then it will add a counter prefix to the output file `--filecounter`. Also, progress is reported as layer number/of layers `--proglayer`. And finally if `--nomove` is provided, no changes to the start-GCode will be made.


## What it does
Post processing for [PrusaSlicer](https://www.prusa3d.com/prusaslicer/), [SuperSlicer](https://github.com/supermerill/SuperSlicer), [OrcaSlicer](https://github.com/SoftFever/OrcaSlicer) to some extend and maybe still [Slic3r](http://slic3r.org).
OrcaSlicer needs more testing as I'm new to it.


## Python Post-Processing Script:
In /[SPP-Python](https://github.com/foreachthing/Slic3rPostProcessing/tree/master/SPP-Python)/ is the Python-version of the "Cura"-move:
1. Heat up, down nozzle and ooze at your discretion.
1. Move to the first entry point on XYZ simultaneously.
    - Before: heat up, ooze, move to first layer height (Z), move to first start point (XY). This could lead to crashing the nozzle into the clips.
    - Now: heat up, ooze, move to first start point (XYZ).
The Python version does not require the verbose mode enabled or any other changes to the Start-, End-, or Layer-code.

Only requirement: the gcode has to have `;HEIGHT:[layer_z]` after `G92 E0`, or after Header G-Code. If you use a recent version of PrusaSlicer, you don't have to do anything. With Slic3r you'd have to add `;HEIGHT:[layer_z]` to the "Before layer change G-Code" field.


### Parameters for the Python Version
- Option: `--xy` will move to X and Y first, then drops on Z (eases-in a bit: full speed to 15 times "first layer height", then at half speed to first layer height).
             Omitting this option will lead to XYZ simultaneous move to first point. This will still clear the clips on the Ultimaker 2 plate. If not, you'd have to edit your start gcode to place the nozzle somewhere "better" (i.e. in the center of the bed) first.
- Option: `--oc` obscures slicer configuration at the end of the file. None of the settings will remain for anyone to see.
- Option: `--rk` removes comments except configuration and real comments.
- Option: `--rak` removes _all_ comments.
- Option: `--backup` Create a backup file, if True is passed. (Default: False).

- Option: `--filecounter` adds a file counter (prefix) to the output file name.
- Option: `--rev` reverse counter (count down).
- Option: `--setcounter  int` set counter manually to this [int].
- Option: `--digits int` set counter's number of digits. I.e. 5 = 00123.

- Option: `--easeinfactor int` Scale Factor for ease in on Z. Z moves fast to this point then slows down.Scales the first layer height by this factor.
- Option: `--notprusaslicer` Pass argument for any other slicer (based on Slic3r) than PrusaSlicer.

- Option: `--iob` if this parameter is provided, individual objects will be printed in blocks. This is required for `--fl` as well.
- Option: `--iobh` sets the max. height of each block to be printed. # # # THIS IS STILL AN EARLY DEVELOPMENT AND DOES NOT PROCUDE SAVE GCODE !!!!!!!!!! You could damage your printer! USE AT OWN RISK!!!
- Option: `--iobfl` if set, the first layer of all objects will be printed first.

- Option: `--craftwaretypes` Pass argument if you want to view GCode in Craftware.
- Option: `--orca2pstypes` Create comments, for OcrcaSlicer to be viewed in PrusaSlicer Viewer.

- Option: `--nomove` If --nomove is provided, no changes to the Start-GCode will be made.
- Option: `--numlayer`  Adds total number of layers to slice-info of G-Code file.
- Option: `--prog` If --prog is provided, a progress bar instead of layer number/percentage, will be added to your GCode file and displayed on your printer (M117).
- Option: `--proglayer` If --proglayer is provided, progress is reported as layer number/of layers, (Default: False)
- Option: `--pwidth int` Define the progress bar length in characters. You might need to adjust the default value. Allow two more chars for brackets. Example: [OOOOO.............].
- Option: `--pchar str` Set progress bar character. (Default: O)
- Required: GCode file name (will be provided by the Slicer; _must_ be provided if used as standalone)



### Installation
Add this line to your "Print Settings" under "Output options" to the "Post-Processing scrips" field:
`<path to python.exe> <path to script>\Slic3rPostProcessor.py;`, 
or `<path to python.exe> <path to script>\Slic3rPostProcessor.py --xy;` (see above).

If you have one or more script active, add this to the correct spot (add new line). Scripts will be processed from top to bottom.

## Individual Objects
You can print print individual objects in blocks. Meaning, if your nozzle has (i.e. 4 mm) clearance to the shroud, you can print individual objects close together (nozzle-radius!) and in blocks of 4 mm height.

Settings for PrusaSlicer:
*  PrusaSlicer:    Print Settings -> Output Options -> Sequential Printing
  * Complete Individual Objects: check (True) -> Advanced Feature
  * Extruder Clearance:  -> Expert Feature
    * Radius (NOZZLE radius, i.e. 4.5 mm (Ã¸ 8 Nozzle))
    * Height (clearance from NOZZLE to SHROUD, i.e. 4 mm)

#### Note
In some cases, unecessary travel moves are made. And sometimes, the alteration between objects does not work as intended. I was looking for to print one object, move to the next, print 4 mm. Then move to the other and print 8 mm. And so on. But, I'm no programmer so if you can spot the issue, please let me know.



## to use in Slic3r
* The option `verbose` in Slic3r _(Slic3r -> Print Settings -> Output options)_, needs to be set to true.
  * In Post-Processing Scripts, add the full path to _this_ exe (see screenshot below).
* In Slic3r -> Printer -> Custom G-Code; add this:
  * Start G-Code:
    * `; START Header`
    * `; ... your header here`
    * `; END Header`
  * End G-Code:
    * `; START Footer`
    * `; ... your footer here`
    * `; END Footer`
  * Before layer change G-Code: `;layer:[layer_num]; \n M117 Layer [layer_num];`
  

## Warning

:warning: A word of warning:

**USE THIS POST-PROCESSING SCRIPT AT YOUR OWN RISK!**

Lots of features have been tested in production. Some didn't.
Some features might lead to crashes of the nozzle and could harm your printer.

**Always check your G-Code before printing!**
